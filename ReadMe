This is an initial PoC for Gatling Performance Testing. 

Performance Testing
Types of performance testing we are planning to achieve. As we will be dealing with Http Request, we mostly will be dealing with a single API at a time. Considering that, the following test scenarios for each API can be proposed

    Step Load Test - This is when rampup option is used to add users to the system at a specific interval and exit at a specific interval
    Spike Test - This is when suddenly a load (users) are added to the system
    Soak/Endurance Test - This is when a constant production load is subjected on to the system

Before subjecting the system to such tests, we may need the following prerequisites to be completed
    Recommendation & selection of tool for load generation & test creation
    Ready to use performance test environment (this should be a copy of the production environment)
    Test creation & benchmarking of different API requests

As the points 2 & 3 will be taken care of post-workshop, the analysis part for the recommendation of a tool has been completed. Following are the observations for the same. 

Gatling

Installation Steps
    Install IntelliJ IDE & Gatling and enable Scala plugin
    Import Gatling archetype from the maven repository
    Create a Load Test
    Create a Maven project using the above archetype
    Update Scala SDK in the IDE (if prompted)
    Following is the framework structure
    Run Engine.scala class
    Post test execution, test report is created

Observations
    GUI available only for recording UI flows, will not be useful in our test scenario
    HTML reports created after every test execution
    Simulation log file is captured
    Every test needs to be scripted in scala
    Time consuming as multiple scala objects & classes need to be created for running a single HTTP request
    No visual representation of the type of performance test like load test or spike test
    All test configurations need to configured through code
    Learning curve present in terms of Scala & performance configuration settings
